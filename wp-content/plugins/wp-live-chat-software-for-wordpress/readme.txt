== Description ==

= WordPress chat plugin =

Want to communicate with customers while they're browsing your website? With LiveChat’s WordPress plugin, you can **connect with them** and **answer questions as they come in**.

= Feature-rich WordPress live chat plugin =

Under the hood, LiveChat offers a number of efficiency features, such as targeted messages. These, for instance, could be used to automatically pop up on your checkout page if a shopper is inactive.

LiveChat’s personalization features are no match for the competition. You can customize colors and messages to match your website. It’s possible to set up different themes for the mobile experience, and you can add team photos for more personalized interactions.

But that’s not all. It’s a snip to set up quick replies to answer repetitive questions and create chat tags to streamline communication. To ease your customer support processes, you can handle multiple chat windows across different pages.

With LiveChat you can **provide 24/7 customer support**. During your off-hours, your customers will still be able to message you in the chat widget - just as they would if your team was online. All of their messages will be stored within LiveChat, ready to be replied to.

= Live Chat for WordPress website =

One of the key things about this plugin is that it is designed to work with the most popular WordPress site builders - Elementor Page Builder, Divi Builder, WordPress Page Builder, Beaver Builder, to name a few.

In addition, LiveChat works well with any WordPress theme or WordPress template without requiring any modifications.

Want to communicate with shoppers while they’re browsing your WordPress store? LiveChat has partnered with the major ecommerce platforms, including BigCommerce for WordPress, WooCommerce, and Ecwid Ecommerce Shopping Cart.

= Easy to customize and extend =

From email marketing to social media, LiveChat **integrates seamlessly** with a range of popular third-party apps and services. These include Zendesk, Messenger, HubSpot CRM, WhatsApp, Mailchimp, Salesforce, and others.

== What is live chat for WordPress? ==

If you have a website and you are serious about your business, you cannot overlook the importance of live chat.

The way this plugin works is simple: a typical chat widget sits on the bottom right side of your WordPress website. Your website visitors can choose to chat with you, or you can actively engage them with chat invitations. Plus, you can use the widget as a contact form for offline messages or even to enable customers to sign up to your mailing list.

Live chat software is perfect for businesses of all sizes, enabling them to close more sales and improve customer satisfaction scores.

= Usage =

Once you install and activate the plugin, it will prompt you to connect to your LiveChat account or create a new account. After syncing the two, you’ll have to log into one of LiveChat’s applications - web, desktop, or mobile.
